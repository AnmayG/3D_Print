Explanation as to what material actually is.

```{r select_data}
data <- read_rds("data.rds")
clean_data <- data %>%
                select(material, roughness, material, tension_strength, elongation) %>%
                arrange(material) %>% 
                mutate(trial_number = row_number()) %>%
                mutate(is_rough = roughness > 200)
```

Effect of Material on Roughness:

```{r roughness}
roughness <- clean_data %>%
               ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = roughness, fill = material)) +
               geom_col() +
               facet_wrap(~ material, scale = "free_x") +
               labs(title = "Effect of Material on Roughness",
                    subtitle = "ABS is much rougher than PLA on the same or similar\n print settings.",
                    x = "Trial Number",
                    y = "Roughness (Âµm)",
                    fill = "Material",
                    caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
roughness
ggsave("images/material1.png", roughness)
```

Effect on Tension Strength:

```{r tension}
tension <- clean_data %>%
             ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = tension_strength, fill = material)) +
             geom_col() +
             facet_wrap(~ material, scale = "free_x") +
             labs(title = "Effect of Material on Tension Strength",
                    subtitle = "PLA is stronger overall, but ABS can be stronger\nwhen it has the right settings.",
                  x = "Trial Number",
                  y = "Tension Strength (MPa)",
                  fill = "Material",
                  caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
tension
ggsave("images/material2.png", tension)
```

Effect on Elongation:

```{r elongation}
elongon <- clean_data %>%
             ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = elongation, fill = material)) +
             geom_col() +
             facet_wrap(~ material, scale = "free_x") +
             geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) + 
             labs(title = "Effect of Material on Elongation Percentage",
                  subtitle = "Overall, ABS is much less likely to deform than PLA,\nonly deforming at the same level as or less than PLA.",
                  x = "Trial Number",
                  y = "Elongation (%)",
                  fill = "Material",
                  caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
elongon
ggsave("images/material3.png", elongon)
```
