```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(rmarkdown)
library(tidyverse)
```

I used data from a 2019 experiment in Selcuk University about using an Ultimake S5 3-D printer that simply did a large number of test prints with different settings and filaments.

Below is an animation of the data and how every setting can create a change in the final product's strength.
Columns to the right of the line are properties of the print while columns to the left are the settings that constructed the print.

```{r gif}
knitr::include_graphics("total.gif")
```

We can also look at the data itself.

```{r}
data_thing <- read_rds("data.rds")
paged_table(data_thing)
```

This makes up the data of my project, and I'll be going into it in more depth later.
