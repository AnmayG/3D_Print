This is essentially an animation of the data and how every setting can create a change in the final product's strength.
Columns to the right of the line are properties of the print while columns to the left are the settings that constructed the print.

```{r gif}
knitr::include_graphics("total.gif")
```

```{r pull_and_save}
plots <- c(`Layer Height and Roughness` = "images/layer1.png",
           `Layer Height and Tension Strength` = "images/layer2.png",
           `Layer Height and Elongation` = "images/layer3.png",
           `Wall Thickness and Roughness` = "images/wall1.png",
           `Wall Thickness and Tension Strength` = "images/wall2.png",
           `Wall Thickness and Elongation` = "images/wall3.png")
```

Each factor has its own unique effect on the strength and quality of the 3D print.

```{r}
bsselect(plots, type = "img", show_tick = TRUE)
```
