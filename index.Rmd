3D printing is one of the coolest high-tech products there is, and it's revolutionized our world.

So what actually makes a 3D print strong?

After examining the data, we found that each factor has its own unique effect on the strength and quality of the 3D print.

Currently, the best print uses:  
* 0.06 mm Layer Height  
* 5 mm Wall Thickness  
* 90% Infill Density  
* A Grid Infill Pattern  
* 215°C Nozzle Temperature  
* 95°C Bed Temperature  
* 60 mm/s Print Speed  
* PLA Filament  
* And 75% Fan Speed  

You can see the main graph in the "Graphs" section.
