Explanation as to what infill pattern actually is.

```{r select_data}
data <- read_rds("data.rds")
clean_data <- data %>%
                select(infill_pattern, roughness, material, tension_strength, elongation) %>%
                arrange(infill_pattern) %>% 
                mutate(trial_number = row_number()) %>%
                mutate(is_rough = roughness > 200)
```

Effect of Infill Pattern on Roughness:

```{r roughness}
roughness <- clean_data %>%
               ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = roughness, fill = infill_pattern)) +
               geom_col() +
               facet_wrap(~ material + infill_pattern, scales = "free_x") +
  geom_smooth() +
               labs(title = "Effect of Infill Pattern on Roughness",
                    subtitle = "With a honeycomb infill pattern, PLA prints become more rough.",
                    x = "Trial Number",
                    y = "Roughness (Âµm)",
                    fill = "Infill Pattern (mm)",
                    caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
roughness
ggsave("images/infillp1.png", roughness)
```

Effect on Tension Strength:

```{r tension}
tension <- clean_data %>%
             ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = tension_strength, fill = infill_pattern)) +
             geom_col() +
             facet_wrap(~ material + infill_pattern, scales = "free_x") +
             labs(title = "Effect of Infill Pattern on Tension Strength",
                    subtitle = "With a honeycomb infill pattern, PLA prints become stronger.",
                  x = "Trial Number",
                  y = "Tension Strength (MPa)",
                  fill = "Infill Pattern (mm)",
                  caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
tension
ggsave("images/infillp2.png", tension)
```

Effect on Elongation:

```{r elongation}
elongon <- clean_data %>%
             ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = elongation, fill = infill_pattern)) +
             geom_col() +
             facet_wrap(~ material + infill_pattern, scales = "free_x") +
             labs(title = "Effect of Infill Pattern on Elongation Percentage",
                  subtitle = "The infill pattern does not affect elongation.",
                  x = "Trial Number",
                  y = "Elongation (%)",
                  fill = "Infill Pattern (mm)",
                  caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
elongon
ggsave("images/infillp3.png", elongon)
```
