[What is bed temperature?](https://all3dp.com/2/3d-slicer-settings-3d-printer/#temperature)

```{r select_data}
data <- read_rds("data.rds")
clean_data <- data %>%
                select(bed_temperature, roughness, material, tension_strength, elongation) %>%
                arrange(bed_temperature) %>% 
                mutate(trial_number = row_number()) %>%
                mutate(is_rough = roughness > 200)
```

Effect of Bed Temperature on Roughness:

```{r roughness}
roughness <- clean_data %>%
               ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = roughness, fill = bed_temperature)) +
               geom_col() +
               facet_wrap(~ material) +
               geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) + 
               labs(title = "Effect of Bed Temperature on Roughness",
                    subtitle = "When the bed temperature is higher, the printer is less\nlikely to make mistakes and create a rougher surface.",
                    x = "Trial Number",
                    y = "Roughness (Âµm)",
                    fill = "Bed Temperature (mm)",
                    caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
roughness
ggsave("images/bed1.png", roughness)
```

Effect on Tension Strength:

```{r tension}
tension <- clean_data %>%
             ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = tension_strength, fill = bed_temperature)) +
             geom_col() +
             facet_wrap(~ material) +
             geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) + 
             labs(title = "Effect of Bed Temperature on Tension Strength",
                    subtitle = "When the bed temperature is higher, the print is less likely to\nsustain a high load.",
                  x = "Trial Number",
                  y = "Tension Strength (MPa)",
                  fill = "Bed Temperature (mm)",
                  caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
tension
ggsave("images/bed2.png", tension)
```

Effect on Elongation:

```{r elongation}
elongon <- clean_data %>%
             ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = elongation, fill = bed_temperature)) +
             geom_col() +
             facet_wrap(~ material) +
             geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) + 
             labs(title = "Effect of Bed Temperature on Elongation Percentage",
                  subtitle = "When the bed temperature is higher, the print is less likely to\nelongate and deform.",
                  x = "Trial Number",
                  y = "Elongation (%)",
                  fill = "Bed Temperature (mm)",
                  caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
elongon
ggsave("images/bed3.png", elongon)
