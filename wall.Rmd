Explanation as to what wall thickness actually is.

```{r select_data}
data <- read_rds("data.rds")
clean_data <- data %>%
                select(wall_thickness, roughness, material, tension_strength, elongation) %>%
                arrange(wall_thickness) %>% 
                mutate(trial_number = row_number()) %>%
                mutate(is_rough = roughness > 200)
```

Effect of Wall Thickness on Roughness:

```{r roughness}
roughness <- clean_data %>%
               ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = roughness, fill = wall_thickness)) +
               geom_col() +
               facet_wrap(~ material) +
               geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) + 
               labs(title = "Effect of Wall Thickness on Roughness",
                    subtitle = "The higher the wall thickness, the more likely the printer\nis to make mistakes and create a rougher surface.",
                    x = "Trial Number",
                    y = "Roughness (Âµm)",
                    fill = "Wall Thickness (mm)",
                    caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
roughness
write_rds(roughness, "wall1.rds")
```

Effect on Tension Strength:

```{r tension}
tension <- clean_data %>%
             ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = tension_strength, fill = wall_thickness)) +
             geom_col() +
             facet_wrap(~ material) +
             geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) + 
             labs(title = "Effect of Wall Thickness on Tension Strength",
                    subtitle = "The higher the wall thickness, the more likely the print is to\nsustain a high load.",
                  x = "Trial Number",
                  y = "Tension Strength (MPa)",
                  fill = "Wall Thickness (mm)",
                  caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
tension
write_rds(tension, "wall2.rds")
```

Effect on Elongation:

```{r elongation}
elongon <- clean_data %>%
             ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = elongation, fill = wall_thickness)) +
             geom_col() +
             facet_wrap(~ material) +
             geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) + 
             labs(title = "Effect of Wall Thickness on Elongation Percentage",
                  subtitle = "The print is more likely to elongate and deform when there are\n6mm of wall.",
                  x = "Trial Number",
                  y = "Elongation (%)",
                  fill = "Wall Thickness (mm)",
                  caption = "Source: Selcuk University, February 26th 2019")
elongon
write_rds(elongon, "wall3.rds")
```
